# My-Food-App
1. This is a Food Recipes application, where we can browse recipes from various different kind of meal and diet types.
2. Our application works with both Remote and local data sources. And for Remote data source we use a third party API for food recipes, called Spoonacular.
3. we send GET Request to our API and receive a list of food recipes as a Response. Also our app is able to handle no internet connection, and store or cache the data localy to our database when it's needed.
